Hello, my name is Denis Chernov.

Currently I work as a full-stack web developer at Yandex.Market. Before that I've been freelancing
and helping run events. I am passionate about pretty much everything IT: from networking and servers
to streaming and VR.

If you want to get in touch, your best way would be to [email](mailto:twkr@twkr.dev) me.
Alternatively, you can find me on [Mastodon](https://hdev.im/@twkr) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/d-chernov).
I don't use any of ~~Facebook~~ Meta products. If someone there is using any of my handles, they are impostors
pretending to be me.
